        <h1>Privacy Policy for Sling-Drive</h1>
        <p>Last Updated: February 2026</p>
        
        <div class="legal-box">
            <p>Vimtronic built the <strong>Sling-Drive</strong> app as a commercial app. This service is provided by Vimtronic and is intended for use as is.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>1. Information Collection and Use</h2>
        <p>We do not directly collect, store, or process any personally identifiable information from users of Sling-Drive. We do not operate any servers that store user data.</p>
        
        <p>However, the app does use third-party services that may collect information used to identify you:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google Play Services</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543" target="_blank">AdMob</a></li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>These services may collect data such as device identifiers, IP addresses, and usage information to provide and improve their services, including serving advertisements.</p>

        <h2>2. Advertising</h2>
        <p>Sling-Drive displays advertisements through Google AdMob. AdMob may use your device's advertising ID and other information to show you personalized ads. You can control ad personalization through your device settings:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Android: Settings &gt; Google &gt; Ads &gt; Opt out of Ads Personalization</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For more information about how AdMob uses data, please see AdMob's privacy policy linked above.</p>

        <h2>3. Log Data</h2>
        <p>In the event of an error in the app, third-party services (such as Google Play Services) may collect log data from your device. This log data may include information such as your device's IP address, device name, operating system version, app configuration, the time and date of the error, and other diagnostic statistics. We do not have direct access to this log data.</p>

        <h2>4. Cookies</h2>
        <p>This app does not directly use cookies. However, third-party services integrated into the app (such as AdMob) may use cookies or similar technologies to collect information and improve their services. You have the option to accept or refuse these cookies through your device settings, though refusing them may affect the functionality of advertising services.</p>

        <h2>5. Service Providers</h2>
        <p>We use third-party companies and services (such as Google Play Services and AdMob) to support our app's functionality and to display advertisements. These third parties may have access to information collected by their services to perform tasks on our behalf. They are obligated not to disclose or use the information for any other purpose.</p>

        <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Sling-Drive does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone, including children under the age of 13. If you are a parent or guardian and you believe your child has provided information through third-party services integrated into our app, please contact us at hello@vimtronic.com so we can work with the relevant service providers to address the issue.</p>

        <h2>7. Security</h2>
        <p>While we do not collect or store user data ourselves, we expect our third-party service providers to use commercially reasonable means to protect any information they collect. However, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure.</p>

        <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>
